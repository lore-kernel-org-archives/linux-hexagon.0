Subject: [PATCH 03/10] Remove unneeded include of version.h from arch/hexagon/include/asm/spinlock_types.h

"make versioncheck" points out that arch/hexagon/include/asm/spinlock_types.h
does not need to include version.h .
A quick look at the file seems to confirm its findings, so here's a patch that
removes the include.
