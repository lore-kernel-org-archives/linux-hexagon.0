This is a small collection of patches that I've been sitting on for probably
too long that I'm getting ready to make a pull request for.  It's largely
cleanup and fixes from the original Hexagon upstreaming, with a few
additional enhancements to do_page_fault and SMP startup which have already
been on the mailing lists for some time.

Please let me know if there are any issues, and thanks to everyone who sent
patches.
