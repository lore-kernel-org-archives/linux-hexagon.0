I don't know the answer to your question, but I've added Mark Salter,
Guan Xuetao and Tobias Klauser to the list, since they probably have
the same issue on c64x, unicore32 and nios2. c64x is currently nommu,
but there is a similar problem with uclibc and I expect that architecture
to grow an mmu at some point.

As far as I can tell, there is now a total of six architectures using
the generic syscalls (not counting s*core, because that relies on
the deprecated calls) and at least two unnamed ones waiting to have
their coming-out, plus a few stagnated ports (lm32, arc, mmix, meta, ...)
that would need to get converted if someone wanted to push kernel
support upstream.
