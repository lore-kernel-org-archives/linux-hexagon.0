This is the third version of the patchset to the Linux kernel to support
the Qualcomm Hexagon architecture.  These patches have been organized like
the last time, in a somewhat logically grouped fashion.

A summary of changes from the last patchset:
* removed __delay
* cleaned up checksum header to pull generic one
* implemented vDSO so signal trampolines are no longer on stack
* fixed cpu_idle()
* removed init_IRQ() wrapper
* cleaned up (most of) the wrongness in time.c
* cleaned up smp.c to use more generic IPI handlers
* filled in ins/outs routines in IO and other misc cleanup
* removed redundant vunmap from ioremap
* removed more highmem cruft
* moved rwsem to asm-generic
* bonus ifdefs added to generic checksum.h

Also, I have been compiling with sparse and it seems to pass.

These patches are available on Code Aurora:

Thanks again for everyone's feedback!
