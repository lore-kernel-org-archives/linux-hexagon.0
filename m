One of the the cool features of PTRACE_GETREGSET is that it returns
the regset in the natural layout of the tracee.  So when debugging a 
32-bit process on a 64-bit kernel, PTRACE_GETREGSET returns the
regset in 32-bit layout.  Recent enough GDBs can print the siginfo of a
caught signal (before its delivered with (PTRACE_CONT, sig).
Try "(gdb) p $_siginfo" on x86.  Trouble is 32-bit processes on 64-bit
kernels or other biarch setups.  PTRACE_GETSIGINFO returns the siginfo in
64-bit layout, so GDB gets to try to immitate what the kernel's 32-bit
compat layer does.  Both for reading and writting siginfo.
See compat_siginfo_from_siginfo and siginfo_from_compat_siginfo
at [1].
The kernel already knows to convert siginfo to the native layout
of the process -- needed to pass to the user space signal handler
at least.  But AFAIK, there's no way for the debugger to get at it
before the signal is actually delivered.
