The following patches clean up various issues with the signal and return
path parts of the Hexagon arch port, which were pointed out by Al Viro:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/2/11/128

The work pending check was moved into a C routine to make it more
readable and to make sure we repeat the check when necessary.  Also, various
arguments and return values for signal handling should now be fixed.

The patches can also be viewed in the context of my next batch of cleanups
at my repo:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rkuo/linux-hexagon-kernel.git


Any feedback is appreciated.


Thanks,
Richard Kuo
