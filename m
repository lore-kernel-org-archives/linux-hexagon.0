Hi, Linas,
  For unicore32, we have our own porting version of glibc, so conflict
problems are solved when one abi defined. We will modify the code of
kernel and glibc together to maintain the consistence.
  So, sadly, you must choose one to modify (patching and re-building),
otherwise you must choose old good-matched versions.
  For getdents (or other deprecated syscalls), we select getdents64 to
replace getdent, though we have not verified it on unicore32 platform. I
think it's reasonable, and perhaps modifying/rebuilding glibc is enough
for the whole file-system (there are always some applications which do
do syscalls and handle structs by themselves).
  Another words, compatibility is very important, so making the decision
with your team.
