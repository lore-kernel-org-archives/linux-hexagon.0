Do you have a publically-available version? Have you considered
submitting it to the FSF?  Have you signed the copyright-transfer
forms with the FSF?

My goal with the hexagon archiecture is to have the kernel asm/unistd.h
include asm-generic/unistd.h, and have glibc compile (on hexagon) with
no further #defines in asm/unistd.h.  This "almost" works today; with
Chris Metcalf's generic syscall patches for glibc, I am able to compile
glibc (and pass the glibc test suite). However, I have to #define
__ARCH_WANT_SYSCALL_DEPRECATED to do this. If I don't, then the 
getdents syscall fails to compile; I don't know how many others there are.

As to the "API": I just want to use Arnd's "generic" kernel support;
that will be the API.  No changing, porting, hacking :-)
