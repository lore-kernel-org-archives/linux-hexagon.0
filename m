No worries; we all have too much to do ;-)

That should be fixed; fingers crossed :-)

My grep spots:

arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:               trace_hardirqs_on();
arch/arm64/include/asm/daifflags.h:     trace_hardirqs_off();
arch/arm64/include/asm/daifflags.h:             trace_hardirqs_off();

The _on thing should be replaced with something like:

	trace_hardirqs_on_prepare();
	lockdep_hardirqs_on_prepare();
	instrumentation_end();
	rcu_irq_exit();
	lockdep_hardirqs_on(CALLER_ADDR0);

(as I think you know, since you have some of that already). And
something similar for the _off thing, but with _off_finish().

I know ... been there etc.. :-)

Possible yeah.

Ohh.. I didn't know it woke up *that* often. I just know Will made use
of it in things like smp_cond_load_relaxed() which would be somewhat
similar to a very shallow idle state that looks at the TIF word.
