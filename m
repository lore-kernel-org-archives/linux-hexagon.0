I think we should strive to just make this all common.

The reason alpha is different is almost certainly not intentional, but
a combination of "pure accident" and "nobody actually cares".

I'd just unify this all, probably with a preference for existing
semantics on x86 (because of "biggest and most varied user base").

That whole "send SIGBUS even for kernel faults" is certainly bogus and
against the usual rules. And I may well be to blame for it (I have
this memory of disliking how EFAULT as a return code didn't actually
return the faulting address). And realistically, it's also just not
something that any normal application will ever hit.  Giving invalid
addresses to system calls is basically always a bug, although there
are always special software that do all the crazy corner cases (ie
things like emulators tend to do odd things).

I doubt such special software exists on Linux/alpha, though.

So I wouldn't worry about those kinds of oddities overmuch.

*If* somebody then finds a load that cares, we can always fix it
later, and I'll go "mea culpa, I didn't think it would matter, and I
was wrong".
