Firstly, what I said for getdents64 in unicore is just in developing,
not ready yet.
And for glibc part, it need much time to prepare for submitting.

It's also my goal. And you have walked further than me.
I guess, Chris don't need getdent for tile, since he didn't export the
syscall in kernel.
IMO, it's better to add one syscall instead of
__ARCH_WANT_SYSCALL_DEPRECATED in your own unistd.h:

#define __NR_getdents 1065
#define __ARCH_WANT_SYS_GETDENTS
__SYSCALL(__NR_getdents, sys_getdents)
