Yes, definitely. What I was really trying to say here is I consider openrisc
an obvious exception to the 'no more ports without upstream gcc' rule
because of the above.

On a related note, has anyone successfully built an openrisc kernel with
llvm/clang? As we discussed for arch/hexagon/, that architecture is unlikely
to ever get an upstream gcc port, but like openrisc does have an upstream
llvm port and they actually use that.

I know that x86 and arm64 mostly work with llvm, arm32 works in some of
the more common configurations at least (not big-endian or older CPUs
though) and some others probably work as well. I have already build both
gcc-5.5 and gcc-7.3 for openrisc and uploaded those to
https://www.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/files/bin/, but if llvm works as
well, that could be one more reason to try to build a working set of
clang based cross toolchains.
