I mean that if we want to deprecate rlimit and stat syscalls for
architectures that are under development now, it's better to upstream
patches that actually deprecate it as early as possible.

OK. Let's leave things as is. But then I don't see any reason to
add unxstat patch to ilp32 series if ilp32 will not disable it.
