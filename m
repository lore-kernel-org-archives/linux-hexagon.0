I'm kind-of vague on this, but I think that this also needs a
: "memory" at the end (to indicate that the asm snippet clobbers
memory), as otherwise the compiler may be tempted to reorder
these around other memory accesses. That is, the "volatile"
keyword is not enough (well, I'm not sure...), but I think
"volatile" only prevents the compiler from optimizing these
away completely, but is not enough to prevent unwanted
re-ordering.
