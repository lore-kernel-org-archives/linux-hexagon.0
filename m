On nios2 we're using an outdated eglibc version (based on glibc 2.5)
right now and thus we still rely on our own non-asm-generic version of
asm/unistd.h

I'm currently in the process of converting our arch to solely use
asm-generic header wherever possible one of which is the syscall ABI.
This will also mean we'll have to redo the libc parts.
