The Hexagon kgdb implementation is incomplete; I work on it as time
permits and urgency requires.  I know from direct experience that,
for kernel bringup and stress testing on new platforms, that kdb is=20
invaluable, being infinitely easier to use than any hardware debugger.
(cheaper, too)

This world could use a really cheap, easy-to-setup jtag debugger.
