Will fix.

Yes I think so.

The patch avoids the page fault retry, including the mmap lock/unlock side.
Now if we retake the lock for fixup_user_fault() we still safe time for
pgtable walks but the lock overhead will be somehow kept, just with smaller
critical sections.

Some fixup_user_fault() callers won't be affected as long as unlocked==NULL
is passed - e.g. the futex code path (fault_in_user_writeable).  After all
they never needed to retake the lock before/after this patch.

It's about the other callers, and they may need some more touch-ups case by
case.  Examples are follow_fault_pfn() in vfio and hva_to_pfn_remapped() in
KVM: both of them returns -EAGAIN when *unlocked==true.  We need to teach
them to know "*unlocked==true" does not necessarily mean a retry attempt.

I think I can look into them if this patch can be accepted as a follow up.

Thanks for taking a look!
