For renameat my main concern was the ABI, and I didn't think it was worth the effort or slightly increased complexity to ifdef the implementation since it was such a trivial wrapper around renameat2. Getrlimit and setrlimit aren't much more complex, just a user copy in addition to the standard doprlimit, so i probably wouldn't have bothered for them either.
