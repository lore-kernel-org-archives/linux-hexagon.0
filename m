Yes, absolutely correct. Specifically, this is required for the
case where you first store values into regular memory and then
use the writel() to trigger a DMA operation. Without the memory
clobber, the dma may read from memory before the CPU has accessed
it in case the store gets scheduled after the writel by the compiler.
