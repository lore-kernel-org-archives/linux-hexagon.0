I apologize for the slow-motion return of our glibc port to the community. 
We have a signed FSF copyright-transfer on file, which we've already used
for binutils, and gcc is in progress, but glibc is not quite at the top of
the stack yet.  It's the curse of being a small company with new features
to write, bugs to fix, and customers to keep happy :-)

Our 2.11.2 port is here:

http://www.tilera.com/scm/glibc-2.11.2.tar.bz2

Wwe are using 2.12 for our upcoming release, which is based around RHEL 6. 
We have not tried to return this to the community yet because there are
plenty of small cleanups to do: another pass through the code to make sure
there are no lingering minor issues, sync up to the git tip, check all the
code style issues, update copyrights, write changelogs, etc.

For getdents in particular, we use this patch:

Indeed.
